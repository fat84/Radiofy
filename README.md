# Radiofy

This is an Angular2 music web application that uses the **Spotify API** to search artists, albums and tracks information.

[Demo](https://spotify-app-d35a2.firebaseapp.com/)

## This App offers the following characteristics:

- Search for Artists
- Browse Artits's Albums
- Play albums tracks

## Contributing Bugfixes or Features

For submitting something back, be it a patch, some documentation, or new feature requires some level of community interactions.

Committing code is easy:

- Fork the this repository
- Create a local development branch for the bugfix; I recommend naming the branch such that you'll
  recognize its purpose.
- Commit a change, and push your local branch to your github fork
- Send me pull request for your changes to be included

I apologize in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues.
